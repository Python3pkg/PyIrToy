PyIrToy
=======

A python module for transmitting and receiving infrared signals from an IR Toy.
This requires the Dangerous Prototype USB IR Toy 
(http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/USB_Infrared_Toy) with firmware revision 22
or higher.

This module has been tested with Python 2.7 and 3.2 on Ubuntu 12.04.  There is 
no OS specific code in this module, so it should work on Mac OS and Windows but
has not been tested.

This module makes it easy to transmit to and receive from an IR Toy, eg:

```python 
import serial
import irtoy

with serial.Serial('/dev/ttyACM0') as serialDevice:

    # create a new instance of the IrToy class
    toy = irtoy.IrToy(serialDevice)
    
    # receive an IR signal from the IR Toy, stored in a list.
    # Note: this call will block (hang) until an IR code has been received.
    irCode = toy.receive()

    # transmit the recorded signal back to the IR Toy
    toy.transmit(irCode)

    toy.close()
```
