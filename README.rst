PyIrToy
=======

A python module for transmitting and receiving infrared signals from an IR Toy.
This requires the Dangerous Prototype USB IR Toy 
(http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/USB_Infrared_Toy) with firmware revision 22
or higher.

This module has been tested with Python 2.7 and 3.2 on Ubuntu 12.04.  There is 
no OS specific code in this module, so it should work on Mac OS and Windows but
has not been tested.

This module makes it easy to transmit to and receive from an IR Toy.  The wiki
has some quick examples.
